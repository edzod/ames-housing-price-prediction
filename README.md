# Ames Housing – Price Prediction (ML Coursework)

**Grade:** 100/100 (final project)  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  

Two-part Machine Learning project on the **Ames Housing dataset**:  
- **Part A (baseline):** EDA, data cleaning, basic feature engineering, PCA, and baseline models (KNN, LWLR, Decision Tree).  
- **Part B (advanced):** extended feature engineering, ensembles, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and a reproducible ML pipeline.
